Contribution of each member:

Collectively we all contributed in the patterns function, and main function

Mohammad: Square functions, comments and docstrings

Faisal: Circle functions

Khadija: Hexagon functions, x and y coordinates

Describtion:
The code creates an interactive program where users can input colors for shapes,
and it generates a pattern of hexagons, circles, and squares arranged in three rows, 
each with three repetitions of the shapes.
